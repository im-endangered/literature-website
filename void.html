                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Mid December, winter was getting colder every day.
                        Days were short too. The environment outside used to be so busy; heavy traffic, horns of
                        vehicles, pedestrians walking home...</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">There was a bus stop in a distance. People were
                        waiting bus to travel home. The stop was so special, at least to me, because it was the place
                        where I first met her.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">She was so special to me. Her name was enough for me
                        to melt even in these cold days of December. She used to call me, often, when she was free. Her
                        name was saved in my phone in special encoded name which only she and I understood. The moment
                        she used to call me or text me used be so damn special. She used to say, " It's been three days
                        already. Aren't you interested to meet me any longer? Or are you busy?" " I'm always free for
                        you", I used to reply.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">" I'll be waiting. Same bus stop! Don't you dare be
                        late" had become her signature dialogue.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">It was weird that the day she used to call, I used to
                        get tangled into some stuffs, getting late every time. I used to glance myself into mirror,
                        manage my messed-up hair with fingers and rush to the stop.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">She'd be waiting for me, using her mobile phone. She
                        would just get up and start walking as soon as she would see me. I used to try to get up to her
                        pace, but silently. We'd walk miles without saying a single word. "God! 15 minutes late is not a
                        joke"- she used to murmur. After some more walk she used to break silence by saying," It's
                        always you who gets late. Always you who don't initiate conversation. It always has to be me to
                        talk first. It's getting late. Aren't you taking me for a coffee?"</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Convincing her, I used to take her to caf√© near the
                        end of 69th street. Same table, same corner; it felt like the place was specially made for us.
                        We were regular customer there. Conversation used to get longer and deeper... Her waterfall-like
                        beautiful hair used to cover her face sometimes which she used to manage beautifully. I could
                        feel her eyes get wider when she was excited and narrow when she was shy. Sometimes, my finger
                        would get tangled with her hair too. It was common for us to hold hands and feel our heartbeat
                        getting faster.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">When waiter used to come around, she used to snitch
                        her hands off mine. That used to hurt, but I never dared to tell her.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">This winter wasn't new,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">This cafe wasn't new,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">The place and the table we were sitting weren't new,
                    </p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Her name in the table, which I wrote with help of my
                        fingernails wasn't new, and,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">The taste of coffee wasn't new,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">They all were old, just like our relation....</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Sipping on coffee she started saying,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">" I was trying to tell you something since a while but
                        I didn't know where to start from. Mmmmm. I think this taste of coffee will now be alienated."
                    </p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">I said," Why? Are you going other city for job?"</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">"Not job actually... Do you think I can find same
                        taste of coffee in Belgium?"</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">I was shocked. "Belgium? Why? How? What are you trying
                        to say?"</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">"I should have told you earlier, but I didn't have
                        guts. There's someone special of mine there in Belgium. He said he'll come in January for me.
                        Everyone knew. It was just you left........"</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">The turbulences around changed to void. Her and mine
                        name written on table became blurry. The coffee which I always admired became tasteless. I
                        started remembering my past.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">That past,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">When we were always eager to meet each other.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">I remembered the bus stop where she used to wait for
                        me. I remembered texts she sent me. I remembered those sleepless nights.....</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">"What's wrong? Aren't we leaving? It's already 7' .
                        Let's go! I've already paid for the coffee." I regained my senses with her words. </p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">There nights aren't like before,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">I wake up with her messages,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Her texts scare me nowadays.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Maybe she liked spending her free time with me. Maybe
                        I was wrong ...</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Dreaming of being with her just because she wanted to
                        meet me,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Wishing her to be mine just because she wanted to meet
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Maybe I was wrong... Getting lost in her sweet words
                        with each sip of coffee</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">That bus stop feels incomplete these days,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Anyone using mobile phone feels like her. There's no
                        one to get angry over me even if I get an hour late. The coffee in the cafe feels tasteless....
                    </p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">These days, I just smoke her memories to make that
                        tasteless coffee sweet again. And with each puff of smoke I try to blow away her memories.</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Time is same, location is same, I am same,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Only difference,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">Yesterday,</p>
                    <p class="about__description" id="home-about">She, me and coffee</p>
